# Analog & Digital Signals

an analong clock is run by gears and time is shown by handles that spin to show the 12 hours of a day compared to a digital clock that showeds time with  a numeric display that indicates the exact time the singanls between analog and digital waves. Analog waves are smooth and continuous but  digital waves are stepping, square, and discrete.
